# React 18 LoginApp

### Work in progress

##### Worth to clarify

It began as project to understand OAuth2 protocol for authentication, but as things were caming I decided to go further to cover the different concepts involved in a webapp development.
Therefore the name of this repository (LoginApp) is misleading, since it will be a more complete fullstack app.

I will summarize the aspects that are involved, **to delve into them later**:

- [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol for authentication
- Global state with Redux
- Managing routes in UX
- Server app with [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for practicing non relational database
- Testing

### Libraries/plugins added to this project@Silvana llamé a Rosi, y está al tanto

(Some of them are about to be implemented or are incomplete)

## Introduction

This is a React 18 App created with Vite. It uses Typescript and Tailwindcss. The skeleton of this project is based on my [react-vite repository](https://github.com/rossanag/react-vite). There you'll find all the installations and configuration I needed to have a ready setup from scratch.

Operative System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### Run example

- **backend**  : the backend code folder. To run the server, get into this carpet and type: `npm start`
- **frontend** : the frontend code folder. Get into this folder and type to launch the webapp: `npm run dev`
